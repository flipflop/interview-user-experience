# Interview Questions: User Experience

- What attracted you to become a User Experience Professional?

- Decribe a difficult project

- Describe a successful and rewarding project

- UX and UI design, can you descrbibe what both are?

- What are some of the emerging trends in UX Design right now?

- If tasked to perform a UX evaluation or audit of a product, what would your process look like to accomplish this? Can you tell me about a project you did this for and what the outcome of the evaluation was?

- Why did Google Make Page Speed an Important Ranking Factor for Websites?

- Scenario: You arrive on a legacy Web Project, that utilises an address locator. The designer choose to make all the available options available in a drop down component.
	- Explain what problems this may present
	- Explain alternative UI Controls which may solve this problem better
	
	```Answer:``` the drop down will have far too many options to be easy to navigate for users (drop downs should only handle around 5 - 8 items). The solution can be improved greatly by using a Typeahead component to dynamically match searches for Car Models

- How do you work effectively and communicate with designers, developers, product owners and testers?

- Who is Edward R Tufte?

	```Answer:``` Edward Rolf Tufte (born March 14, 1942) is an American statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University. He is noted for his writings on information design and as a pioneer in the field of data visualization.

	```Bonus:``` if 'Envisioning Information' or 'Chart Junk' is mentioned

- Who is Jakob Nielsen?

	```Answer:``` Jakob Nielsen (born 1957) is a famous web usability consultant. He holds a Ph.D. in human–computer interaction from the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.

	Nielsen has also defined the five quality components of his "Usability Goals", which are:

	1. Learnability
	2. Efficiency
	3. Memorability
	4. Errors (as in low error rate)
	5. Satisfaction

	Nielsen has been criticized by some graphic designers for failing to balance the importance of other user experience considerations such as typography, readability, visual cues for hierarchy and importance, and eye appeal.

	Nielsen writes a fortnightly newsletter, Alertbox, on web design matters and has published several books on the subject of web design. After his regular articles on his Web site about usability research attracted media attention, he co-founded usability consulting company Nielsen Norman Group with fellow usability expert Donald Norman.


- What is a Heuristic?

	```Answer:``` A heuristic technique; Ancient Greek: εὑρίσκω, "find" or "discover"), often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.

- When would you use Guerilla Usability Testing?
	- How would you go about conducting a test in a coffee shop?
	
	```Answer:```
	
	- Beware of implicit bias. (Acknowledging implicit bias can help designers neutralise subjective experiences and account for individual differences. Beware the implicit bias. While coffeeshops are a great place to find test participants, focusing on people who frequent them introduces bias to our work.)
	
	- Explain what’s going on. (Ensure people are fully aware of the implications of their participation - which may involve a release form)
	
	- Be open and ethical. (White lies may be necessary in order to frame the study without skewing results, always ensure at the end of the session you communicate the true purpose.)
	
	- Make it casual. (Lighten up tests by offering cups of coffee and/or meals in exchange for people’s time.)
	
	- Involve people. (Break down barriers by getting people involved: ask them to draw – on a napkin or piece of notebook paper, for example – what they might expect to see on the third or fourth screen of a UI flow.)
	
	- Don't lead or dictate (mitigate the feeling of being observed / tested)
	
	- Pay close attention (It’s important to encapsulate passing thoughts for later analysis. Ethnographic observation is one good way to capture what you were thinking of during tests.)
	
	- Capture feedback (There are a few preferred tools available: apps like Silverback or UX Recorder collect screen activity along with a test subject’s facial reaction. Other researchers build their own mobile rigs.)
	
	- Manage your time and theirs (Be respectful of the time people give you, this isn’t a usability lab with paid users. Be mindful of how much time you spend with test subjects)

- Have you run Usability testing sessions with participants?
	- if you how did you conduct the sessions to get the best results?
	- what was the most surprising results from a Usability test for you?

- What is an Experience Map?

	```Answer:``` An experience map is a strategic tool for capturing and presenting key insights into the complex customer interactions that occur across experiences with a product, service, or ecosystem. 
	
- What is an Customer Journey Map?

	```Answer:``` A customer journey map is a detailed visual document that captures the customer experience across touch points, including what the customer is doing, thinking, and/or feeling. Typically contain fewer process details, but more information about the customer experience. Can be experience-centric.
	
- What is a Service Blueprint?

	```Answer:``` A service blueprint is a detailed visual document that captures the service delivery process across touch points, including the back stage and front stage of the service delivery. Service blueprints contain fewer experience details, but more information about the processes that deliver the service. Can be process-centric.

- Explain: 

	<b>1. Design Thinking</b>
	
	```Answer:``` Design thinking is a formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems and creation of solutions, with the intent of an improved future result. In this regard it is a form of solution-based, or solution-focused thinking – starting with a goal (a better future situation) instead of solving a specific problem. By considering both present and future conditions and parameters of the problem, alternative solutions may be explored simultaneously. Nigel Cross asserted that this type of thinking most often happens in the built, or artificial, environment (as in artifacts).

	Unlike analytical thinking, design thinking includes "building up" ideas, with few, or no, limits on breadth during a "brainstorming" phase. This helps reduce fear of failure in the participant(s) and encourages input and participation from a wide variety of sources in the ideation phases. The phrase "thinking outside the box" has been coined to describe one goal of the brainstorming phase and is encouraged, since this can aid in the discovery of hidden elements and ambiguities in the situation and discovering potentially faulty assumptions.

	One version of the design thinking process has seven stages: define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn

	<b>2. Lean Startup</b> 

	```Answer:``` Lean startup is a method for developing businesses and products first proposed in 2008 by Eric Ries. Based on his previous experience working in several U.S. startups, Ries claims that startups can shorten their product development cycles by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and what he calls validated learning. 

	<b>3. Lean UX</b> 

	```Answer:``` Lean UX describes methods and their practical application in dynamic environment of a Lean Startup. Lean UX unites product development and business, through constant measurement and so called “learning loops” (build – measure – learn). It also encourages more focussed UX processes that reduce wasted effort, focussing on higher value outcomes for the Customer.

		- What are the similarities?

- What is an MVP?

	```Answer:``` a **Minimum Viable Product** (a minimum product tha will support the basic customer needs, that becomes a solid foundation for a larger product refined over time with direct customer feedback and metrics for measuring success of new feature "hypothesis" via "Test and Learn" Lean Startup Principles)
	
- What is an MMP?
	
	```Answer:``` a **Minimum Marketable Product** (a minimum product that can be supported by the available market). Note: some argue the MVPs, although needed by the customer may not be marketable because of immaturity of the marketplace or the education required to convince customers of it's need (at scale) if the product is particularly groundbreaking or disruptive.

- Name 2 User Experience Design Patterns

	```Answer:``` examples include:
	
	(Interaction)
	
	1. Progressive Disclosure
	2. Primary, secondard and tertiary calls to action
	3. Mobile: Pull to refresh / reload / update
	4. Mobile: "Tinder Swipe" to navigate large lists of binary decisions
	5. Mobile: Swipe to remove or edit list items
	
	(Components)
	
	1. Breadcrumb
	2. Date Picker
	3. Site Search
	4. Carousel: Note carousels are [conversion killers](http://www.usefulusability.com/kill-conversion-killing-carousels-now/) and UX Anti-patterns
	5. Typeahead

- When would you use Progressive Disclosure?

	```Answer:``` Progressive disclosure is an interaction design technique often used in human computer interaction to help maintain the focus of a user's attention by reducing clutter, confusion, and cognitive workload. This improves usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the task at hand. Typically examples are for help and additional information sections, revealed by clicking a 'more information on' link.

- What is a Skeumorphism?

	```Answer:``` Skeuomorphism is the design concept of making items represented resemble their real-world counterparts. Skeuomorphism is commonly used in many design fields, including user interface (UI) and Web design, architecture, ceramics and interior design.

- Why did **Flat UI** partly fail?

	```Answer:``` it attempted to remove many Skeumorphic elements and decoration in order to fully embrace modern Digtial Design. Unfortunately many of the elements removed improved the affordance of interactive elements, which includes buttons and links which became indestinguishable from other page content.  For example, many designers are attempting to add borders or drop shadows to buttons in order to raise their visual prominance (depth) and improve affordance.

- Why are animations and transitions so important in Flat UI?

	```Answer:``` Animations and transitions, when used correctly, can provide additional context to the user of how certain operations affect them or provide a clear indication of how application context may change (transition) from one state to another. 

- What is Empathy Mapping?
	- Why is it so important to understand User Motivations and Frustrations?

- What is a Design System?

- What is a Global Experience Language (GEL)?
	
	```Answer:``` a constantly evolving and customer tested style guide of page components (Pattern Portfolio / Living Style Guide). The GEL provides consistency in communication and interaction patterns for UX professionals and Designers. It also provides a set of re-usable common components for an organisation, improving the quality of digital solutions (through consistency) and increases economies of scale by reducing design, development and testing effort.

	- What is a Living Style Guide?
	- What is a Pattern Portfolio?
	- Why are Components so important in Design, Development and Testing?

- What are some of the main Accessibility considerations that affect User Experience Design decisions?

	```Answer:```
	 
	- Some users have motor impairment (Not all users use a mouse, some may require keyboard control or other Assistive Technologies - like a mouthpiece)
	- Some users are vision impaired (e.g. partially sighted, blind, colour blind or tunnel vision)
	- Some users have reading difficulties (e.g. cognitive impairment and dyslexia)

- How do you keep your knowledge up to date?
	- e.g. blogs, articles, websites and social feeds
	- Who do you follow?
